### Summary 
Titanic data shows that people of higher classes had a higher likelihood of survival than people of lower classes. This may be due to various reasons such as passengers of lower classes being farther away from the boat deck, confined by locked gates, and not speaking English well enough to find help. The upper class comprised of social elites who paid between £30 and £870, middle class comprised of mostly tourists who paid on average £13, and lower class comprised of mostly emigrants who paid on average £7.

### Design
I chose to use a bar chart to compare the survival rates between the classes. I opted not to use the stacked bar chart but instead to use the grouped bar chart to give the audience more information about the exact numbers that perished and survived in each class. Also, to show that the Titanic comprised of much more lower class passengers than middle and upper class passengers. I added in the filtering by 'survived' interaction to show the unproportional amount of lower class passengers who perished compared to those that survived. After the first feedback, I added more information on the dataset in the Summary, including how the classes were determined and possible reasons for the disparity in survival rates among the classes. After the second feedback, I corrected the position of the description text and legend text to make them more centered. 

### Feedback 
Feedback Questions:
1. What do you notice in the visualization?
2. What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?
3. Do you have any questions or suggestions for improvement?

First Feedback:
1. There are more lower class people on Titanic than there are upper class people, which is surprising to me since I would expect there would be more upper class people. Most of the people that died on the boat were from the lower class.
2. The main takeaway is to show how there’s a correlation between class and survival rate.
3. Improvements: Explain why you think there’s a correlation between these two variables. Also explain what factors were used to separate by class. Was it income? If so, what were the numbers?

Second Feedback:
1. The trend of the grey (Perished) went from high to low from lower class to upper class. 
2. The higher ticket you paid for the less likely you are to die.
3. Reorient the text, it looks a little lop-sided.
